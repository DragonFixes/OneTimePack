## About OneTimePack
If you have mutliple servers in a proxy with same resource pack you probably experienced the annoying situation where you already downloaded or denied the resource pack, but when you move to other server, the resource pack request window appears again.

OneTimePack plugin acts like a filter in your proxy (bungeecord or velocity) server to avoid double sending the same resource pack.
